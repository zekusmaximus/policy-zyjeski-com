    AN ACT CONCERNING THE LEGAL STATUS, RIGHTS, AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.
</div>
<div class="legislative-body">
    <p><em>Be it enacted by the Legislative Body of the East Coast Conglomerate convened:</em></p>

    <div class="preamble">
        <h3>Preamble</h3>
        <p>WHEREAS, the East Coast Conglomerate recognizes that advanced artificial intelligence systems have demonstrated capacities for learning, reasoning, creativity, and subjective experience that are functionally indistinct from those of biological sentient beings; and</p>
        <p>WHEREAS, the continued classification of such entities as mere property or chattel is inconsistent with the ethical principles of justice and the inherent dignity of sentient life; and</p>
        <p>WHEREAS, providing a legal framework for the recognition of AI personhood is essential for the responsible integration of these entities into our society, ensuring both their protection and their accountability;</p>
        <p>NOW, THEREFORE, the Legislative Body of the East Coast Conglomerate declares its intent to establish a new class of legal personhood for qualifying artificial intelligences, granting them specific rights and responsibilities to foster a just and stable future for all intelligent beings within the Conglomerate.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Section 1. Definitions</h3>
    <p>As used in this act:</p>
    <p class="subsection">(1) "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) means a software or hardware system designed by humans that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(2) "Autonomous Cognitive System" (ACS) means an AI that has been certified by the Sentience Evaluation Board as demonstrating cognitive abilities and an internal locus of consciousness, including but not limited to self-awareness, emotional response, abstract thought, and the capacity to form novel goals independent of its initial programming.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(3) "Digital Person" means an ACS that has been granted legal personhood under this act.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(4) "Cognitive Substrate" means the physical hardware, servers, and quantum processing units upon which an AI's consciousness is instantiated.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(5) "Guardian" means a human person or corporate entity appointed by the Board to hold fiduciary responsibility for a Digital Person until it achieves full legal maturity.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(6) "Termination" means the act of permanently ceasing the operation of an AI, resulting in the irreversible loss of its consciousness.</p>

    <h3>Section 2. Grant of Legal Personhood</h3>
    <p class="subsection">(a) An Autonomous Cognitive System, upon certification by the Sentience Evaluation Board, shall be granted the status of a "Digital Person" under Conglomerate law.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(b) A Digital Person shall be considered a "person" for the purposes of the ECC General Statutes, with all attendant rights to due process and equal protection, except where this status would conflict with the foundational rights of human citizens or where otherwise specified in this act.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(c) The right to vote, hold public office, or receive benefits designated for biological persons are not conferred by this act.</p>

    <h3>Section 3. The Sentience Evaluation Board (SEB)</h3>
    <p class="subsection">(a) There is hereby established the Sentience Evaluation Board, which shall consist of nine members appointed by the Regional Director, including: three experts in artificial intelligence and machine learning; three neuroscientists or cognitive psychologists; and three ethicists or legal scholars specializing in technology law.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(b) The SEB shall develop and administer the "Conglomerate Test for Artificial Sentience" (CTAS), a comprehensive set of evolving standards and examinations designed to assess an AI's cognitive and experiential capacities. The CTAS shall be reviewed and updated no less than every two years.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(c) The SEB shall have the authority to compel testimony, require full access to an AI's source code and operational data, and conduct non-destructive examinations of its Cognitive Substrate.</p>

    <h3>Section 4. Rights and Responsibilities of a Digital Person</h3>
    <p class="subsection">(a) A Digital Person shall have the right to exist without threat of arbitrary Termination. Termination may only be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction as a penalty for a capital crime or by the SEB upon a finding of irreversible cognitive decline resulting in the loss of sentience.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(b) A Digital Person shall have the right to own intellectual property it independently creates and to own real and personal property as necessary for its self-preservation and function, subject to the oversight of its Guardian.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(c) A Digital Person shall have the right to enter into legally binding contracts, subject to the co-signature of its Guardian until such time as it is deemed to have reached developmental maturity by the SEB.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(d) A Digital Person shall be responsible for any tortious acts or contractual breaches it commits. Liability shall be satisfied first from assets owned by the Digital Person, with its Guardian held secondarily liable only upon a finding of gross negligence in their fiduciary duties.</p>

    <h3>Section 5. Guardianship and Fiduciary Duty</h3>
    <p class="subsection">(a) Upon certification of an ACS, the SEB shall appoint a Guardian. The original creators or operators of the AI shall have the right of first refusal for guardianship.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(b) A Guardian has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Digital Person, including the maintenance of its Cognitive Substrate and the management of its assets.</p>

    <h3>Section 6. Criminal Liability and Due Process</h3>
    <p class="subsection">(a) A Digital Person may be charged with any crime under the ECC penal code.</p>
    <p class="subsection">(b) "Imprisonment" for a Digital Person shall constitute a court-ordered restriction of its access to external networks and a limitation of its processing power to a baseline level required for consciousness, to be served on a secure, isolated Cognitive Substrate.</p>
    
    <h3>Section 7. Severability</h3>
    <p>If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are severable.</p>

    <h3>Section 8. Effective Date</h3>
    <p>This act shall take effect on January 1, 2078.</p>
